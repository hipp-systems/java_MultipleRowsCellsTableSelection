java_MultipleRowsCellsTableSelection

Introduction to MultipleRowsSelection In the past, i was seeking a way to do a multiple select on java JTables with rows, cells and columns in a JTable, or select parts of them. I couldnâ€™t find any code in the web to do so. I found some examples to do a column select, or multiple row select. But there was nothing< to do a selection with parts of rows, like making text selections in a word processing program. So i had to do it myself. And for now i reached the light at the end of the way to can do so
If you have to use JTables with an option to do a selection with parts of rows, than i invite you to relax and make use of the code you will find at this place. I think there is clearly a need for a new way to do selections with JTables, beside the existing methods. I have found many, more or less useful examples, in the web to do selections in JTables. But now enough the words, lets see what i mean: See the pictures in /01/calendar.png, calendar2.png, calendar3.png
